The website is no longer active but I am happy to provide a private demo upon request. This was a fun project because it involved a chair spin animation and countdown based on the number of entries a user had made. I created the chair spin animation by using css animation to transition over a sprite sheet. I was responsible for coding the frontend. It was also a fun learning experience because it was my first time interacting with a Graphql api.","tech":["Vuejs","javascript","html/css","apollo/graphql on frontend"],"id":"lays"},{"title":"Pepsi Gift it Forward","link":"","description":"On this project I assisted in creating various modules and functionality behind one of our Senior Developers. The most interesting feature that I created was an image generator that would create an image with the users name and a phrase that they selected on a small gift card picture. To do this I used canvas to generate the image. The challenge I faced was how to center text based on different font sizes and name lengths. This promotion is over but I can provide a private demo upon request.","tech":["Vuejs","javascript","html/css","html canvas"],"id":"pepsi"}]}}}')},"t+fG":function(e,t,a){var n=a("P8UN"),i=a("96qb"),r=a("ap2Z"),s=/"/g,o=function(e,t,a,n){var i=String(r(e)),o="<"+t;return""!==a&&(o+=" "+a+'="'+String(n).replace(s,"&quot;")+'"'),o+">"+i+"</"+t+">"};e.exports=function(e,t){var a={};a[e]=t(o),n(n.P+n.F*i((function(){var t=""[e]('"');return t!==t.toLowerCase()||t.split('"').length>3})),"String",a)}},y7hu:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("t+fG")("link",(function(e){return function(t){return e(this,"a","href",t)}}))}}]);
