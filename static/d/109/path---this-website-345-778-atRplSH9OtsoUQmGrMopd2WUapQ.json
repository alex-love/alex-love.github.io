How do we define a bagel?</h4>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/browse/bagel\">dictionary.com</a>, a bagel is  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a leavened, doughnut-shaped, firm-textured roll, with a brownish\nglazed surface, made of dough first poached and then baked.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, now that we are familiar with a basic definition of a bagel, I will proceed with my rant.  </p>\n<h4>Seo Intermission</h4>\n<p>Every good blog post that contains anything slightly resembling a recipe in any capacity needs to include a brief novel filled with keywords. The importance of this is so that Google leads you to my true bagel recipe later. See what I did there, I wrote about my super awesome bagels that I love to make. Here is the point in this paragraph where I admit that I’m a fraud… I’ve never actually made bagels. I’m just a huge bagel snob that believes that we need higher bagel standards in the great USA. We have fancy ketchup, a rating by the USDA that requires a certain tomato concentration, when will we have fancy bagels? I’m so worked up about this that I’m actually procrastinating my real life responsibilities. I’m so worked up that I’m going to go make my own bagels.  </p>\n<p>At this point, you’re fed up with me and frustrated that I’ve never even made bagels… It’s fine, I’m frustrated too. I’m going to make them today and I’ll include the recipe I use at the bottom. </p>\n<h4>2. I believe that Safeway bagels are not boiled</h4>\n<p>An important step in the bagel making process, I believe that Safeway does not boil their bagels. If my suspicion is true, Safeway bagels are simply bread in the shape of a bagel. You may be thinking “but bagels are bread”, and you are correct. Bagels are indeed bread, but just because Safeway makes bread does not mean that they make bagels. Bagels are bread, but not all bread is bagels. A basic logic course, or just common reasoning, will confirm this. </p>\n<h2>A Call To Action</h2>\n<h4>Spread the Bagel Love</h4>\n<p>Not everyone is fortunate enough to live somewhere with access to high quality and affordable bagels. Fortunately, bagels can be made from home with a bit of trial and error. </p>\n<h4>Bagel Basics, a Recipe</h4>\n<h5>Ingredients</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Flour</li>\n<li>Salt</li>\n<li>Yeast</li>\n<li>Barley malt syrup</li>\n<li>Oil</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A found this recipe on slate.com which reinforced my opinion about the need of malt syrup and boiling, so <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2014/04/authentic-bagel-recipe-you-need-barley-malt-syrup-and-boiling-water.html\">this</a> is the recipe I will be using.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yield: 10 to 12 bagels\n4 cups all-purpose flour\n2¼ teaspoons instant yeast or one ¼-ounce packet active dry yeast\n2 teaspoons salt\n¼ cup barley malt syrup\nOil for greasing the bowl and pan</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add 1½ cups warm water—about the same temperature as the inside of your wrist—and 2 tablespoons of the barley malt syrup. Stir with the dough-hook attachment of a stand mixer or by hand until combined.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Knead the dough with the dough-hook attachment of a stand mixer or by hand until it feels smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes, adding flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking. Grease a large bowl (it’s fine to use the same one you mixed the dough in), add the dough, and turn it over to coat it lightly with oil or butter. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, put it in a warm place, and let the dough rise until doubled in size, at least 1 hour and preferably overnight.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Heat the oven to 425°F, and put 6 cups of water in a large pot over high heat. When it boils, add the remaining 2 tablespoons barley malt syrup and adjust the heat so it simmers steadily. Add three or four of the bagels to the boiling water and cook, turning once, until they are firm and golden, 1½ to 2 minutes. Remove the bagels from the pot with a slotted spoon and return them to the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining uncooked bagels.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bake the bagels until they are evenly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Update</h4>\n<p>If you’ve made it this far, I’ll inform you that I did in fact make these bagels. Unfortunately the extent of my good news has ended. Aesthetically speaking, these bagels are the worst thing I’ve ever created in my life. My first grade painting of a coffee cup that looked like a splotch of brown on a piece of paper looks good compared to how these bagels turned out. </p>\n<h4>The important thing: Taste</h4>\n<p>Aesthetics aside, these bagels tasted better than they looked. In fact, I ate 4 bagels within a 24 hour time period (close to my record 6). </p>\n<h4>A conclusion</h4>\n<p>Not gonna lie, making these was a decent amount of effort. But if effort = bagels, it was worth it. For the first time in a long time I ate a true bagel, ugly but true. But life isn’t about good looking bagels (at least until I can make them), it’s about true bagels, and now we have that. I leave this experience hopeful and optimistic. After creating something so ugly, it’s only up from here. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Safeway Bagels in My Town are not Bagels","date":"February 10, 2019","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/this-website/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/reflections-on-the-process/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reflections on my learning process: Programming and Computer Science","published":true}}}}
