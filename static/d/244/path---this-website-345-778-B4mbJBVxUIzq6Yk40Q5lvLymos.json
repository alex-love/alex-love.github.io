After working with/in Wordpress for a while, I really wanted to get as far away from it as I could. Nothing against Wordpress, it has a time and a place, I just needed a break. I chose Gatsby because it allowed me to continue working with React, with additional technologies such as Graphql. It’s also nice to get the performance and security benefit that comes from using a static site generator.</p>\n<h4>Process</h4>\n<p>I started this website from a popular blog starter theme. The main changes I made were adding my resume and project section.</p>\n<h4>JSON Resume</h4>\n<p>I thought it would be cool to have my resume data easily editable and queryable.
