After working with/in Wordpress for a while, I really wanted to get as far away from it as I could. Nothing against Wordpress, it has a time and a place, I just needed a break. I chose Gatsby because it allowed me to continue working with React, with additional technologies such as Graphql. It’s also nice to get the performance and security benefit that comes from using a static site generator.</p>\n<h4>Process</h4>\n<p>I started this website from a popular blog starter theme. The main changes I made were adding my resume and project section.</p>\n<h4>JSON Resume</h4>\n<p>I thought it would be cool to have my resume data easily editable and queryable. To do this, I decided to store my resume data is a JSON file. Through the power of Gatsby, Graphql, and a JSON plugin, I could easily query and manipulate my resume data.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">dataJson{\n        work{\n          currentJob\n          company\n          position\n          highlights\n          startDate\n          endDate\n          highlights\n        }\n        skills{\n          name\n          level\n          keywords\n        }\n      }\n  }</code></pre></div>\n<p>The same was true for my skills section, and with this query I could simply map out my keywords. This would make adding anything in the future easier, and I could change the formatting easily without worrying about the content.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"This Website and Hosting with Github pages","date":"May 10, 2019","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/this-website/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/reflections-on-the-process/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reflections on my learning process: Programming and Computer Science","published":true}},"next":null}}
