It was made in Vuejs and involved some trickly elements, such as setting up the svg border to scale properly.

The website is no longer active but I am happy to provide a private demo upon request. This was a fun project because it involved a chair spin animation and countdown based on the number of entries a user had made. I created the chair spin animation by using css animation to transition over a sprite sheet. I was responsible for coding the frontend. It was also a fun learning experience because it was my first time interacting with a Graphql api.","link":"","title":"Lay's Giveaway promotion website","tech":["Vuejs","javascript","html/css","apollo/graphql on frontend"],"imgSrc":"projects/lays.png","id":"lays"},{"description":null,"link":"","title":"Pepsi Gift it Forward","tech":["Vuejs","javascript","html/css","html canvas"],"imgSrc":"projects/pepsi.png","id":"pepsi"}]}}}
