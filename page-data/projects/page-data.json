The website is no longer active but I am happy to provide a private demo upon request. This was a fun project because it involved a chair spin animation and countdown based on the number of entries a user had made. I created the chair spin animation by using css animation to transition over a sprite sheet. I was responsible for coding the frontend. It was also a fun learning experience because it was my first time interacting with a Graphql api.","tech":["Vuejs","javascript","html/css","apollo/graphql on frontend"],"id":"lays"},{"title":"Pepsi Gift it Forward","link":"","description":null,"tech":["Vuejs","javascript","html/css","html canvas"],"id":"pepsi"}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
