I originally made this as a simple portfolio to hopefully get my feet a little wet in React, and also to have a site to show potential employers. That worked fine, but a year later I went back to update this site and I was a little confused to say the least.</p>\n<h3>Initial confusion</h3>\n<p>This website is currently deployed on github pages. When I initially went to my github account, I was surprised that the repository hosting this website was just some built files… Where the heck was my actual source code living? Upon a little digging, I realized that I had set up a different repository to host my source, so to deploy this I was running a build in my source repository and then copying the build output into my other repo. This isn’t ideal so I’m going to change how that works. </p>\n<h3>Update</h3>\n<p>So as I was writing this, I realized that my deployment process actually wasn’t that bad. I have a deploy script that runs the build and then uploads to my repository that is setup for Github pages. I felt that rather than delete my last paragraph I would propose a little bit of reflection on coming back to this project.</p>\n<h3>Importance of documentation</h3>\n<p>If you anticipate that you will ever need to return to a project… which is pretty common, it is in your best interest to document things well. Upon my discovery I am updating my README. That way if I ever need to come back and remember how to redeploy, or just do any other task, I will have a starting point. I won’t have to try to remember what I was doing a year ago. </p>\n<h3>Future improvements</h3>\n<p>One thing I would like to add to this project is a better deployment process. Instead of manually running a script when I am ready to deploy, I would like to add a Github action or webhook that will do it for me. So anytime I push to Master or whatever branch, a build is triggered for me.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Trying to update this portfolio/blog a year later","date":"June 06, 2020","description":"A lot has changed and I would have made this differently."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/update/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/this-website/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"This Website and Hosting with Github pages","published":true}},"next":null}}}
