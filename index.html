                I was the sole developer on this project. I used VueJs and and implemented localization for the project. One challenge was theming the project for different retailers via a different retailer specific route. I solved this by utilizing localStorage and using middleware for my router to serve the appropriate assets and copy.

                On this project I worked with several other developers to complete features for a web coloring book. I worked on all supporting pages of the experience, including a color palette and draw tool selection ui component.

                This website was a giveaway website created for Lay's and The Voice. The website is no longer active but I am happy to provide a private demo upon request. This was a fun project because it involved a chair spin animation and countdown based on the number of entries a user had made. I created the chair spin animation by using css animation to transition over a sprite sheet. I was responsible for coding the frontend. It was also a fun learning experience because it was my first time interacting with a Graphql api.

                This was a holiday sweetstake giveaway website. I developed a gift-tag image generator component using canvas, a social-sharing component, and also improved error handling for the api calls.

                  This website was a quick turnaround holiday website. It involved some fun page transitions and other general animation. I am proud of the quality of this project given the very short development time of two weeks. Unfortunately this project was short lived and I am happy to provide a private demo upon request.

                This was a wine website made in Vue.js. It includes several dynamic pages that are generated through json files. The greatest challenge on this website was creating the wine description drop down effect, which involved animating the height on a container below a wine.

                I was the sole developer on this project. It was made in Vue.js and involved some trickly elements, such as setting up the svg border to scale properly. It also includes integration with Curate.io to add an Instagram feed, as this was a fully static website.
