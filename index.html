                I was the sole developer on this project. I used VueJs and and implemented localization for the project.
                One challenge was theming the project for different retailers via a different retailer specific route. I
                solved this by utilizing localStorage and using middleware for my router to serve the appropriate assets
                and copy.

              <p>
                On this project I worked with several other developers to complete features for a web coloring book. I
                worked on all supporting pages of the experience, including a color palette and draw tool selection ui
                component.

                This website was a giveaway website created for Lay's and The Voice. The website is no longer active but
                I am happy to provide a private demo upon request. This was a fun project because it involved a chair
                spin animation and countdown based on the number of entries a user had made. I created the chair spin
                animation by using css animation to transition over a sprite sheet. I was responsible for coding the
                frontend. It was also a fun learning experience because it was my first time interacting with a Graphql
                api.

              <p>
                This was a holiday sweetstake giveaway website. I developed a gift-tag image generator component using
                canvas, a social-sharing component, and also improved error handling for the api calls.

                This website was a quick turnaround holiday website. It involved some fun page transitions and other
                general animation. I am proud of the quality of this project given the very short development time of
                two weeks.

                This was a wine website made in Vue.js. It includes several dynamic pages that are generated through
                json files. The greatest challenge on this website was creating the wine description drop down effect,
                which involved animating the height on a container below a wine.

                  I was the sole developer on this project. It was made in Vue.js and involved some trickly elements,
                  such as setting up the svg border to scale properly. It also includes integration with Curate.io to
                  add an Instagram feed, as this was a fully static website.

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>While I have taken a decent amount of CS coursework through highschool, college, and beyond, I mostly consider myself a self-taught developer. A lot of my professional experience is frontend related, but on my own I find myself working on more full-stack projects. After all... a lot of the ideas I want to bring to life still need some sort of backend. </p>
      <p>Outside of work I enjoy biking, running, skiing, and occasionally video games. I find it important to maintain a balance between how much I stare at a screen and how active I am. </p>
