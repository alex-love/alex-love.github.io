## My Personal Blog
This website is built using GatsbyJS, and began with a [Gatsby starter blog boilerplate](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)

From this starter blog I have made several changes:
  1. Add my job/resume/skills including custom components as well as basic CSS animation for display toggle.
  2. Custom styling 
  3. Custom template and layout components
