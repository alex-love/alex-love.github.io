# Lots of content
This is so we can see what this stuff looks like. I'm sure it looks okay. Luckily for me, a lot of the functionality of this website has already been set up. You see... I used a theme. I'm still building it to my own needs, but there was a fair bit of boiler plate here.

## Some things I have done myself.
1. Create a way to display job data from a JSON file
2. Write my own blog posts obviously
3. Have a button to hide/show my resume.
