## My History With CS and Programming
It all began when I was a Junior in high school, growing up around computers compelled me to dig a little deeper, to possibly understand how all this software I used was made. I'll admit, the tech-centric mind of silicon valley also played a part in it.

To address this, I enrolled in a computer science class at my high-school. While my school was located in the heart of silicon valley (Palo Alto), we wouldn't have an actual CS teacher until the following year, just a proctor that overseed us taking online community college classes. In total, I took 2 quarters worth of introductory CS classes. They were taught in JAVA and progressed us through the basics of programming and more specifically, OOP in JAVA. 

### My Initial Thoughts -- Confusion
Initially, nothing made sense. From my knowledge, we were writting basic code that was compiled, which my computer would then 'run'. These programs would usually output to the System, or when we got a little more advanced, display some data or text on a Swing panel/frame and possibly have a few editable fields with events tied to them. 

Initially I was interested, but I was deeply lost in the bigger picture. I felt deeply insuperior to my seeming smarter and more knowledgeable peers. My interest was there, but at the same time it was also being crushed by the feeling that trying to learn about this stuff was a lost cause for myself.

Some more advanced students around me were writing applications or more complex code, but I was limited to writing small example programs such as sorting algorithms, or small text games. I knew that in order to do something more sophisticated there was a lot more to learn, but I lacked a sense of direction and was unsure of what small steps in my learning I would need to take to one day make my own Apps or other pieces of software. While discouraged, I still enrolled in APCS for the following school year.

### APCS -- A Strange Deviation from expected
My APCS course was largely useless in terms of direct learning. Whenever I have a bad/negative experience with something, I like to think about what I learned in regards to why I perceived the experience as negative. If I was the teacher, how would I have done things differently. With my further knowledge now, how would I have approached my learning differently?

#### Why the course was poorly taught
For context, my teacher was a self-proclaimed MIT PhD holder. While his qualifications are largely irrelevent, they can perhaps provide some insight into why he taught the course how he did. 

In general, we did not follow any conventional APCS curriculum, my teacher focused largely on advanced data structures such as trees, hashtables, etc... and neglected any standard curriculum. My first couple assignments in the class were to program some scalable visual graphics in Java's standard swing library. He seemed to be concerned with trying to expose us to very advanced material, when we didn't even know how to apply the more basic principles from the previous years coursework. 

So not only was I still lacking a general sense of direction or purpose for what I was learning, but I was only being thrust deeper into the rabbit hole, furthering my sense of self doubt and confusion. 

#### What would I have done differently as teacher?
I think what would have helped me the most in my early stages of learning, would be to get students creating programs that they want to make early on. Guiding them into projects that actually follow some theme of usefullness and utilize relevant proceesses. For example, teaching us to make a user interface that stores account info in a database and displays it. We got so dirty in the time complexity of algorithms (this was in highschool) before we even knew the motivation of such endevours. If we aren't even close to capable of writing an application at scale that will benefit from performance optimization, what is the point of diving into math and algorithms that often aren't taught until later in college?

If you want to motivate a student to learn as opposed to memorize, you need to inspire their curiousity and let the learning occur naturally. My most productive computer science learning has been through trying to solve and optimize my own problems in personal projects, not try to implement a sorting algorithm inspired by previous mathemeticians. I appreciate and understand the usefullness, but early on students just need to code and learn from their mistakes.
