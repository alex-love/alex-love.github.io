## My History With CS and Programming
It all began when I was a Junior in high school, growing up around computers, I was compelled to dig a little deeper, to possibly understand how all this software I was obsessed with was written.

I enrolled in a computer science class at my high-school. While my school was located in the heart of silicon valley (Palo Alto) didn't actually have a CS teacher, we had a teacher who proctored us taking local community college classes. 

In total, I took 2 quarters worth of introductory CS classes. They were taught in JAVA and progressed us through the basics of programming and more specifically, OOP in JAVA. 

### My Initial Thoughts -- Confusion
Initially, nothing made sense. From my knowledge we were writting basic code that was compiled, which my computer would then 'run'. 'Run' usually being an output to the System, or when we got a little more advanced, some basic output in a Swing panel or something along those lines. 

I was interested, but I was deeply lost in the bigger picture. Some more advanced students around me were writing applications or more complex code, but I was limited to writing small example programs such as sorting algorithms, or small text games. I knew that in order to do something more sophisticated I would need a way to store information in something like a database (we learned basic file I/O, including the use of object serialization), but I had no idea where to even look. After finishing 2 quarters of introductory learning, I continued the next year with the advanced placement CS course.

### APCS -- A Strange Deviation from expected
My APCS course was largely useless in terms of direct learning. Whenever I have a bad/negative experience with something, I like to think about what I learned in regards to why I perceived the experience as negative. If I was the teacher, how would I have done things differently. With my further knowledge now, how would I have approached my learning differently? 

#### Why the course was poorly taught
For context, my teacher was a self-proclaimed MIT PhD holder. While his qualifications are largely irrelevent, they can perhaps provide some insight into why he taught the course how he did. 

In general, we did not follow any conventional APCS curriculum, my teacher focused largely on advanced data structures such as trees, hashtables, etc... and neglected any standard curriculum. My first couple assignments in the class were to program some scalable visual graphics in Java's standard swing library.
