### My quest to eat worse, better
I went shopping at Trader Joe's recently and was feeling somewhat healthy. I was browsing the pizza dough area and impulsively decided to get whole wheat dough. Now for context, I'm very opinionated about whole wheat products. I generally believe that while they may result in more fiber, more complex carbohydrates, and more nutrients, whole wheat dough deviates in taste quality so significantly as to result in a net negative.
